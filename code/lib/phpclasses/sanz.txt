Code downloaded from:

- http://www.phpclasses.org/package/3169-PHP-Decode-MIME-e-mail-messages.html
- http://www.phpclasses.org/package/3-PHP-HTTP-client-to-access-Web-site-pages.html

I modified the mime_parser.php file to replace the follows functions:
- fopen by gzopen
- fread by gzread
- fwrite by gzwrite
- fclose by gzclose

This change allow me to optimize the memory usage (a lot of large emails with attachments)
