As PHPExcel includes a copy of the TCPDF library and SaltOS too,
I decided to remove the redundant code with:
- cd lib/phpexcel/PHPExcel/Shared
- rm -rf PDF
- ln -s ../../../tcpdf PDF
With this change, I'm reducing the total size of the libraries!!!

Too, I removed for security reasons the:
- lib/phpexcel/PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/docs
- lib/phpexcel/PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/examples
- lib/phpexcel/PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/tests
