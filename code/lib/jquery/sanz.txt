Fixed a bug in jquery-ui:

I have replaced:

	this._adjustInstDate( inst, offset +
		( period === "M" ? this._get( inst, "showCurrentAtPos" ) : 0 ), // undo positioning
		period );

By the follow simplified code:

	this._adjustInstDate( inst, offset, period );

This change fix the bug when displays more that 1 month at the same time and the showCurrentAtPos is different of 0

And then, minified!!!.
